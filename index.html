 Arunachalam
</h2>
<p>Hi, My name is Arunachalam Kasi, a rising senior attending Dublin High School. My interests include learning new coding languages and networking. I joined ALL STAR CODE since the curriculum aligns with both of my interests. With the SI and Technical skills session, I am able to learn the importance of communication in networking from the guest speakers which have attended the session.
